# Testing Geyser Program Notifications

A common problem many app devs have faced is that fact that program account
subscriptions do not notify the consumer of account ownership changes.

This means that when, for example, an account is closed (reassigned to System),
the consumer of program accounts has no idea it happened.

We may need to come up with a good solution for this.

```
./run.sh
```
